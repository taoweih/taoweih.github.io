                <p>What do business managers and engineers have in common? 
                    You might say, “Nothing.” It’s understandable why people would think that. 
                    After all, business managers and engineers require very different skill sets. 
                    Engineers need a strong foundation in math and sciences, while business managers 
                    often rely on interpersonal and leadership skills. I used to share this belief. 
                    I thought the qualities needed for engineers and business managers were incompatible. 
                    However, I'd like to offer a different perspective. Engineers and business managers do 
                    something in common, and that key factor is abstraction.</p>
                <br>
                <p>My appreciation for the concept of abstraction began in one of 
                    my introductory computer engineering classes. In that class, 
                    we started by learning the construction of a computer from its most 
                    fundamental components. We all know that computers can only read 1s and 0s,
                     but the class started even before that by teaching logic gates 
                     (basic operations like “and” and “or”). We then progressed to more complex 
                     concepts built upon these logic gates, followed by understanding how different 
                     components of a computer are created from these more complex elements. This is the 
                     first level of abstraction. When learning about how different components of a computer 
                     function, we essentially ignored individual logic gates. Considering a single 
                     component could consist of thousands of logic gates, it would be impossible for 
                     the human brain to focus on each one. Yet, we don’t need to focus on 
                     these small details. the power of abstraction allows us to achieve complexity 
                     without needing to know every detail. A modern computer chip contains billions 
                     of transistors, representing billions of logic gates—an order of magnitude beyond
                     what was taught in an introductory computer engineering class. Abstraction is 
                     what enables the creation of such a complex chip.</p>
                <br>
                <p>So, what can business managers learn from this? Too often, 
                    managers attempt to control every detail, wanting to know 
                    precisely what’s happening with regular progress reports 
                    and frequent meetings. While it's essential for managers 
                    to be invested in a team's progress, excessive involvement 
                    can hinder employees’ productivity. In large companies, 
                    employees might spend more time in meetings than actually 
                    working. The analogy between managing and engineering is clear.
                     If a manager fixates on small details, they lose sight of the
                      bigger picture. Their primary role—leading on a large 
                      scale—suffers. By devoting time and attention to every detail
                       of an employee's work, managers leave little room for effective
                        management. Project details are crucial, but they are tasks 
                        for other team members. Just as computer programmers do not
                         need to concern themselves with the intricacies of individual 
                         transistors, managers can operate efficiently through
                          abstraction. Managers should familiarize themselves with the
                           general concepts of their employees' work without micromanaging. 
                           It only hurts both their and employee’s productivity.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Abstraction proves invaluable for both business managers and engineers,
                     as both professions are about solving problems. Abstraction allow them 
                     to have a clear sight of the most prominent problem, safeguarding them 
                     from distractions. Analytical skills geared toward the bigger picture 
                     are increasingly important, particularly in the face of advancing
                      Artificial Intelligence technology. AI excels in managing details
                       and repetitive tasks. Therefore, the ability to think abstractly is 
                       a crucial skill for navigating the future job market.</p>
