                <p>AI is not necessarily a novel concept, however, the growth of AI has been particularly notable in recent years. 
                    AI is likely to be more important in the future. I was first amazed by the capability of AI 
                    when google revealed their Alpha Go. Alpha Go is a computer program that played the board game 
                    Go and won against the best human player in the world. The board game Go has over 10 to the 
                    power of 250 possible moves. It was practically impossible for a computer to store each 
                    potential move. Instead, Alpha Go is a machine learning program trained on board games 
                    played between other skilled players. Alpha Go was able to defeat the best Go player in 
                    the world at the time. I played the board game Go at that time and I was amazed by Alpha Go. 
                    However, the idea of an AI portrayed in the sci-fi films still seemed futuristic at that time. 
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>This all changed when ChatGPT was released. ChatGPT is the first large language model 
                    chat bot that brought artificial intelligence into the public consciousness. From drafting 
                    email to programming algorithm, it can pretty much do anything you asks it to do. With 
                    the release of ChatGPT also comes the fear of AI replacing people’s jobs. However, 
                    if anything is to be learned from history, it’s that this fear is unlikely to occur. 
                    The advancement of technology has always automated the jobs that are repetitive and 
                    boring while allowed human to focus on jobs that are creative. With the help of AI, 
                    managers can lead and manage in a more effective way.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>There are two significant ways in which AI can be highly beneficial for managers. 
                    Managers are often overwhelmed with mundane and repetitive tasks such as sending emails,
                     sending slack and managing schedules. These are crucial duties for managers to perform. 
                     However, they are very time consuming and they take away manager’s time to focus on big 
                     idea and lead the company. Managers can leverage the power of AI to outline emails and 
                     slack to both remain professional-sounding in the communication while still be efficient.
                      AI can also be used as a first step in tasks such as scheduling meeting. Using AI allows 
                      these task to be done quickly so that mangers can focus on larger, goal-oriented tasks. 
                      Brainstorm with AI can be extremely useful. AI has access to a huge amount of text and 
                      content of the internet. It can provide diverse ideas that might not be considered by 
                      people focused on specific areas. Brainstorming also doesn’t require information to 
                      be exactly right, which is a weak point of AI. AI’s strength is highly useful for tasks
                       like brainstorming. AI can also be used to summarize information when managers needs 
                       to go through extensive information quickly. When going through a huge amount of reports,
                        managers can utilize AI to summarize key information and decide which parts to look 
                        at more specifically. On the flip size, AI can be used by managers to expand their 
                        ideas. Managers can present the main points of their ideas and ask AI to outline those 
                        ideas. Then, mangers can expand upon the outline. AI can be used to reduce repetitive
                         tasks and enhance the efficiency of important tasks for managers.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>AI is a tool that will inevitably be more and more relevant in the future. It is a valuable tool for managers to 
                    harness. Its capacity to streamline repetitive tasks empowers managers to concentrate on 
                    more crucial aspects. However, like any other tool, people who use AI must possess 
                    proficient skills to effectively utilize AI meaningfully. </p>
